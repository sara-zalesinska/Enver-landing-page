## Project description

This is a simple landing page. The project was based on a free [Figma]([url](https://www.figma.com/file/oR1doKaZ8Lg5R69beeDjpQ/Digital-Agency-Website---Freebie-(Community)?node-id=2%3A472&mode=dev)https://www.figma.com/file/oR1doKaZ8Lg5R69beeDjpQ/Digital-Agency-Website---Freebie-(Community)?node-id=2%3A472&mode=dev)
design, found on the web. The mobile menu was created by me as it hadn't been included in the Figma file. The project was not a complex one however, it allowed me to practice very important and useful things, such as: 
* use of `position` property
* use of `flexbox` and `grid`
* use of `Swiper API` for carousel with pagination
* creating a custom `video player`

The `video player` controls include: 
* play/pause button
* progress bar
* volume input range
* video speed input range
* skip backwards (10s) button
* skip forward (25s) button

## Technologies and libraries used: 

* Vite
* HTML
* SASS
* Java Script
* Eslint + Prettier
* Swiper
